## 📦 How to Use: Sourcing & Importing Modules

To use any module from this repo, reference it directly in your Terraform configuration using the Git source and a version tag:

```hcl
module "generic_skeleton" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/matthew-dresden/terraform-modules.git//skeletons/generic-skeleton?ref=skeletons/generic-skeleton/v1.0.0"
  # ...module inputs...
}
```

- Replace the module path (`skeletons/generic-skeleton`) with the one you need.
- Replace the version (`v1.0.0`) with the exact tag to pin the module version.  
  ⚠️ **Pinning is required** — Terraform’s `git` source does not support version ranges.

---

### Consuming Modules

Modules are consumed directly from this repository over the Terraform `git::` source protocol, as shown above. Every module is:

- Pinned by an exact tag (Terraform's `git` source does not support version ranges)
- Publicly readable — no authentication required
- Policy-enforced, security-audited, and functionally tested before release

## 🧱 Repository Structure

A clear, logical structure for all modules and supporting files:

```
.
├── generics
│   └── utilities/            # Terraform modules
├── providers
│   ├── aws/
│   │   ├── collections/      # Terraform modules
│   │   ├── primitives/       # Terraform modules
│   │   └── references/       # Terraform modules

│       ├── primitives/       # Terraform modules
│       └── references/       # Terraform modules
└── skeletons                 # Terraform modules
    └── generic-skeleton/
```

## 🔐 Governance

This repository implements governance policies to ensure consistent and maintainable code:

1. **Single Module Policy**: PRs must change only one Terraform module at a time
2. **Separation Policy**: PRs must either modify exactly one module OR only non-module files (not both)
3. **Empty PR Policy**: PRs must contain at least one file change
4. **Module Type Policies**: Each module type has specific content requirements
5. **Module Structure Policies**: All modules must follow a standardized structure
6. **File Organization Policies**: Terraform declarations must be in specific files

These policies are enforced using Open Policy Agent (OPA) in the CI/CD pipeline.

## Security

This repository implements comprehensive security controls:

1. **GitHub Actions Security**: All third-party actions are SHA-pinned to prevent supply chain attacks
2. **External Contributor Protection**: External contributors cannot modify workflow files
3. **Automated Security Scanning**: CodeQL analysis runs on all pull requests
4. **Terraform Security Scanning**: `tfsec` scans every Terraform module change for security issues
5. **Environment Isolation**: External contributor tests run in protected environments
6. **Manual Approval Gates**: Multiple approval points ensure code quality and security
7. **Action Allowlist**: Only pre-approved GitHub Actions can be used in workflows

Security is managed through automated scripts in the [`security-scripts/`](security-scripts/) directory. Use `make github-actions-security` to update action allowlists.

## 🧭 Repository Principles and Strategy

This monorepo is governed by the following principles, which guide all module and service development:

### Self-Contained Repository Deployment Principle
Each module or service in this monorepo is designed to be self-contained, including everything necessary to deploy, test, and validate itself in isolation. This ensures autonomy, reproducibility, and a complete SDLC for every module. See [Self-Contained Repository Deployment Principle](docs/principles/self-contained-repository-deployment-principle.md) for details.

### Single Purpose Repository Principle
Every module or service is focused on a single responsibility, producing a single, environment-agnostic artifact or service. This aligns with the [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) and supports modular, maintainable, and scalable infrastructure. See [Single Purpose Repository Principle](docs/principles/single-purpose-repository-principle.md) for details.

### Terraform Module Strategy
- All cloud, SaaS, and stateful resources are managed via Terraform modules in this monorepo.
- Module types include: Primitive, Utility, Reference, and Client Wrapper modules (see below).
- Modules must be client- and application-agnostic unless explicitly a client wrapper.
- All modules must be created using the latest skeleton and follow all OPA policies, structure, and testing requirements defined in this repo.
- All modules must be semantically versioned and released via CI/CD.
- Use official Terraform providers unless a fork is required for missing features/bugfixes (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for provider forking strategy).

### Terragrunt Usage
Terragrunt may be used in downstream consumer repositories to orchestrate deployments of modules from this monorepo. However, all Terraform code and module logic must reside in this repo, and Terragrunt HCL should only be used for orchestration, not for defining resource logic.

## 🧱 Module Types

This repository supports several types of Terraform modules, each with a specific purpose and scope:

1. **Primitive Modules**:
   - Manages a single major resource type from a provider (e.g., S3, ECS, EC2).
   - These modules are the most complex and where most raw development occurs. 
2. **Utility Modules**:
   - Adds opinionated functionality (e.g., naming/tagging) or provides data-only structures (such as resource naming constraints for every AWS resource).
3. **Collection Modules**:
   - A composition of primitive modules and/or other collection modules.
   - They provide an opinionated, specialized set of resources to support a use case (e.g., EKS cluster integrated with SumoLogic or Datadog).
   - They do not provide a full reference architecture.
4. **Reference Modules**:
   - Provides a fully baked, production-ready service that is secure, observable, follows best practices, and modern architecture patterns. 
5. **Client Wrapper Modules**:
   - Client-specific wrapper that imports reference modules and adds custom logic. Must live in the client’s repo and follow the same structure/testing standards.

All modules must:
- Use the latest skeleton
- Pass all OPA policies and CI/CD checks
- Be fully tested (rego and Terratest)
- Be semantically versioned and released via CI/CD
- Use Apache 2.0 license unless client-specific

## 📦 Terraform Provider Strategy

- Always use the latest stable official provider for all resources.
- If a required feature/bugfix is missing, fork the provider, follow best practices for forking, and upstream changes when possible. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full provider forking workflow.

## 📁 Module Structure

All modules must follow a standardized structure:

- Required files in the root directory (main.tf, variables.tf, etc.)
- Examples directory with at least one example implementation
- Tests directory with corresponding test directories for each example
- Documentation in README.md and TERRAFORM-DOCS.md

See [Module Structure](docs/terraform-module-structure.md) and [Module Policies](docs/terraform-module-policies.md) for detailed requirements.

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

All modules must include comprehensive functional tests using the [Terraform Terratest Framework](https://github.com/matthew-dresden/terraform-terratest-framework):

- Tests for each example implementation
- Common tests that verify basic functionality
- Tests that validate the module's core features
- Tests that ensure inputs are properly processed

See [Module Testing](docs/terraform-module-testing.md) for detailed testing requirements and examples.

## Configuration

### Monorepo Configuration

All monorepo automation is configured through a single centralized file:

```bash
monorepo-config.json
```

This file defines module types, path patterns, policy directories, and other configuration used by all automation scripts. See [Monorepo Configuration](docs/monorepo-config.md) for details.

### Module Automation with mpm

Individual Terraform modules use [mpm](https://github.com/matthew-dresden/mpm), a self-contained manifest package manager, for standardized automation tasks. mpm provides:

- **Versioned Automation**: Pin exact versions of testing, linting, and validation tasks
- **Consistent Tooling**: Same automation across all modules without code duplication
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralized Make targets delivered by the `terraform-module-build` catalog entry
- **Reproducible Resolution**: Every declared source is pinned in `.mpm.lock`
- **Ephemeral Dependencies**: Resolved packages are aggregated into `.packages/` and `.mpm-data/` (git-ignored, never committed)

Install the CLI once:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/matthew-dresden/mpm@v1.0.0
```

Each module contains:
- `Makefile` - mpm orchestration with the `mpm-configure` target (static, rarely changes)
- `.mpm` - the module's manifest, declaring `MPM_SOURCE_<name>_{URL,REF,PATH,NAME}` blocks
- `.mpm.lock` - the resolved pins for every declared source (written by `mpm install`)

**How it works:**
1. The base Makefile provides the `mpm-configure` target
2. Running `make mpm-configure` runs `mpm install`, which resolves every `MPM_SOURCE_*` block in `.mpm` against `.mpm.lock` and aggregates the resulting packages into `.packages/`
3. Those packages provide all module automation tasks (test, lint, format, docs, security)
4. Tasks are only available after `make mpm-configure` has been run

`make mpm-clean` runs `mpm clean`, which tears down `.packages/` and `.mpm-data/`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get up and running as a contributor or consumer:

### Prerequisites

This repository uses [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/) v0.15.0 to manage tool versions:

```bash
# Install required tools for the monorepo
make install-tools
```

### Development Workflow

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required tools: `make install-tools`
3. Configure the environment: `make configure`
4. Create a new module from the skeleton: `cp -r skeletons/generic-skeleton your/new/module`
5. Enter your module directory and configure mpm: `cd your/new/module && make mpm-configure`
   - This resolves the automation package into `.packages/` and makes its tasks available
6. Install module dependencies: `make install`
   - This installs Go modules and the tftest CLI tool
7. Implement your module following the [structure requirements](docs/terraform-module-structure.md)
8. Use the mpm-provided automation tasks (from the module directory):
   - `make test` - Run all Terratest tests
   - `make test-common` - Run common tests only
   - `make tf-format` - Check Terraform formatting
   - `make tf-lint` - Lint Terraform files
   - `make tf-docs` - Generate documentation
   - `make tf-security` - Run security scans
   - `make go-lint` - Lint Go test files
   - `make go-format` - Format Go test files
   - `make clean` - Clean Terraform state
9. Validate your module from repo root:
   - `make module-validate MODULE_PATH=your/new/module MODULE_TYPE=module_type`
10. Test all non-Terraform code: `make test-all-non-tf-module-code` (from repo root)
11. Submit a PR

**Note:** Module automation tasks are delivered by the `terraform-module-build` mpm package and are only available after running `make mpm-configure` followed by `make install`. The base Makefile only provides `mpm-configure` and related mpm management targets.

## 🧪 Workflow Development and Testing

For developers working on the main validation workflow (`.github/workflows/main-validation.yml`):

```bash
# Test all 6 merge approval job variations in dry run mode
make test-main-validation-workflow
```

This comprehensive test triggers all possible merge approval scenarios to validate workflow changes before deployment. See [Main Validation Script Documentation](docs/scripts/main-validation.md) for details.

## ✅ Repository Health Checks

For repository maintainers, a comprehensive test suite is available to validate all Terraform modules:

```bash
# Test all Terraform modules (runs weekly via GitHub Actions)
make test-all-terraform-modules
```

This task runs the full validation suite (documentation, formatting, linting, OPA policies, planning, security, and tests) across all modules in parallel. It's designed for CI/CD use and not required for regular development.

For detailed contribution guidelines, see [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 🔁 CI/CD Workflows Overview

This repository uses a multi-stage, automated CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality, security, and compliance for all contributions. The workflows support both production and dry run (safe testing) modes.

### Main Workflows

- **PR Validation (`pr-validation.yml`)**: Entry point for all pull requests. Detects contributor type (internal/external), enforces workflow file protection, and routes PRs to the correct validation workflow based on whether Terraform modules or non-Terraform code are changed.
- **Main Validation (`main-validation.yml`)**: Core workflow for PR approval, merge decisions, and release orchestration. Handles both Terraform and non-Terraform changes, supports dry run mode, and manages merge approval routing.
- **Release (`release.yml`)**: Handles both Terraform and non-Terraform releases. Uses custom logic for module versioning and `python-semantic-release` for non-Terraform code. Automates changelog generation and tagging.
- **CodeQL Analysis (`codeql-analysis.yml`)**: Runs automated security scanning on all pushes and PRs.
- **Weekly Module Health Check (`weekly-module-health-check.yml`)**: Runs comprehensive tests on all Terraform modules weekly and on demand.

### Security Features
- **Workflow File Protection**: External contributors cannot modify workflow files. Internal contributors must follow the SDLC process for workflow changes.
- **Automated Security Scanning**: CodeQL analysis runs on all PRs and pushes.
- **Manual Approval Gates**: Maintainers must approve PRs and test execution for external contributors.
- **Environment Isolation**: Tests for external contributors run in protected environments.
- **Action Allowlist**: Only SHA-pinned, pre-approved GitHub Actions are permitted.

### Pull Request Flow
1. **Security Check**: Validates contributor type and workflow file changes.
2. **Change Detection**: Determines if the PR changes a Terraform module or only non-module files.
3. **Validation**: Runs comprehensive policy, linting, formatting, documentation, and security checks.
4. **Testing**: Executes full test suite (automatic for internal, manual approval for external contributors).
5. **Approval & Merge**: Maintainers review and approve. PRs are auto-merged after approval (never merge manually).
6. **Release**: Automated versioning (based on PR title) and changelog for both Terraform and non-Terraform code.

See [Workflow Logic](docs/WORKFLOW_LOGIC.md) and [Main Validation SDLC Guide](docs/main-validation-sdlc.md) for full details.
