## Complete SDLC Flow

### 1. Development Phase
- Follow [module structure requirements](terraform-module-structure.md)
- Implement comprehensive tests using [Terraform Terratest Framework](https://github.com/matthew-dresden/terraform-terratest-framework)
- Use conventional commit messages for your local commits (optional - only PR title matters for versioning)
- **Format your PR title** with conventional commit prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.) - this determines the version bump
- Validate locally before submitting

### 2. Pull Request Submission
- **Format PR title** with conventional commit prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.) - this determines the version bump
- **Never manually merge PRs** - the pipeline handles all merges automatically
- **PR Detection**: System detects Terraform module vs non-Terraform changes
- **Security Scanning**: CodeQL analysis starts immediately (parallel to validation)
- **Validation**: Comprehensive policy and quality checks

### 3. Testing Phase
- **Internal Contributors**: Tests execute automatically after validation
- **External Contributors**: Tests require approval via `external-contributor-test-approval` environment

### 4. Main Validation Workflow
- PR validation triggers main-validation workflow
- Routes to appropriate merge approval job based on contributor type

### 5. Merge Approval Gate
- Requires approval via GitHub Environment:
  - Internal (non-self-approve): `merge-approval` environment
  - Internal (self-approve): `merge-approval` environment (manual approval still required)
  - External: `external-contributor-merge-approval` environment
- Slack notifications sent to code owners

### 6. Merge Process
- **System automatically merges PR after approval** (squash merge using PR title as commit message)
- **Never manually merge PRs through GitHub UI** - the pipeline handles all merges
- Feature branch deleted automatically

### 7. Post-Merge Validation
- All validation checks re-run on merged code
- Additional security scanning on main branch

### 8. QA Certification Gate
- Requires approval via `qa-certification` environment
- Slack notification sent after post-merge validation passes

### 9. Release Approval Gate
- Requires approval via `qa-certification` environment
- Triggers release workflow upon approval

### 10. Automated Release
- **Terraform Modules**: Individual semantic versioning per module (based on PR title)
- **Non-Terraform**: Repository-wide semantic versioning (based on PR title)
- Automatic changelog generation and GitHub release creation

## CI/CD Workflows Overview

This repository uses a multi-stage, automated CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality, security, and compliance for all contributions. The workflows support both production and dry run (safe testing) modes.

### Main Workflows
- **PR Validation (`pr-validation.yml`)**: Entry point for all pull requests. Runs the offline gate: the full Go + Rego suite (`make test-all-non-tf-module-code`), and, for a changed Terraform module, `module-validate`, `tf-format`, `tf-docs-check`, `tf-lint` and `terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate`. No AWS credentials are used; `terraform plan`, `tf-plan` and `tf-test` are deliberately not run in CI.
- **Main Validation (`main-validation.yml`)**: _Currently disabled._ Core workflow for PR approval, merge decisions, and release orchestration. Its trigger and jobs are commented out because they require the `GH_APP_ID` / `GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` GitHub App secrets, `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`, and live AWS credentials.
- **Release (`release.yml`)**: _Currently disabled._ Handles both Terraform and non-Terraform releases. Its trigger and job are commented out because they require the `GH_APP_ID` / `GH_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` GitHub App secrets and `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`.
- **CodeQL Analysis (`codeql-analysis.yml`)**: Runs automated security scanning on all pushes and PRs.
- **Weekly Module Health Check (`weekly-module-health-check.yml`)**: _Currently disabled._ Runs `make test-all-terraform-modules` against every module; its trigger is commented out because it provisions live AWS infrastructure.

### Security Features
- **Workflow File Protection**: External contributors cannot modify workflow files. Internal contributors must follow the SDLC process for workflow changes.
- **Automated Security Scanning**: CodeQL analysis runs on all PRs and pushes.
- **Manual Approval Gates**: Maintainers must approve PRs and test execution for external contributors.
- **Environment Isolation**: Tests for external contributors run in protected environments.
- **Action Allowlist**: Only SHA-pinned, pre-approved GitHub Actions are permitted.

### Pull Request Flow
1. **Security Check**: Validates contributor type and workflow file changes.
2. **Change Detection**: Determines if the PR changes a Terraform module or only non-module files.
3. **Validation**: Runs comprehensive policy, linting, formatting, documentation, and security checks.
4. **Testing**: Executes full test suite (automatic for internal, manual approval for external contributors).
5. **Main Validation**: Triggers main-validation workflow with merge approval routing.
6. **Merge Approval**: Requires environment approval (varies by contributor type).
7. **Auto-Merge**: Pipeline merges PR using squash merge with PR title as commit message.
8. **Post-Merge Validation**: Re-runs all tests on merged code.
9. **QA Certification**: Requires environment approval before release.
10. **Release Approval**: Requires environment approval to trigger release.
11. **Release**: Automated versioning (based on PR title) and changelog.

## Terraform and Module Strategy

This monorepo manages all stateful resources (cloud, SaaS, Kubernetes, etc.) using a strict Terraform module strategy:

- **Module Types:**
  - **Primitive Modules:** Manage a single resource type. Must be agnostic, use official providers, and follow the latest skeleton and repo policies.
  - **Utility Modules:** Add opinionated functionality (e.g., naming/tagging). No resource blocks. Must be agnostic and live in this monorepo.
  - **Reference Modules:** Collections of primitives/utilities providing a reference architecture or service. Must be agnostic and tested for integration.
  - **Client Wrapper Modules:** Client-specific wrappers that import reference modules and add custom logic. Must live in the client’s repo and follow the same structure/testing standards.

- **General Requirements:**
  - All modules must use the latest skeleton, pass all OPA policies, and be fully tested (rego and Terratest).
  - All modules must be semantically versioned and released via CI/CD.
  - Use Apache 2.0 license unless client-specific.

- **Provider Strategy:**
  - Always use the latest stable official provider.
  - If a required feature/bugfix is missing, fork the provider, follow best practices for forking, and upstream changes when possible. See below for the provider forking workflow.

- **Terragrunt Usage:**
  - Terragrunt may be used in downstream consumer repos for orchestration, but all Terraform logic must reside in this monorepo.

- **Self-Contained and Single Purpose:**
  - Every module must be self-contained and focused on a single responsibility, supporting the [Self-Contained Repository Deployment Principle](principles/self-contained-repository-deployment-principle.md) and [Single Purpose Repository Principle](principles/single-purpose-repository-principle.md).

## Provider Forking Workflow

If you must fork a provider:
1. Fork the latest provider and add your feature/bugfix.
2. Ensure full testing and no regressions.
3. Use the fork in your module and deliver to production.
4. Create a tech debt story to upstream your change.
5. Refactor to use the official provider once merged.
6. If frequent changes are needed, manage your fork with a full pipeline and regular merges from upstream.

## Module Types and Structure

This repository contains different types of Terraform modules:
- **Primitive Modules**: Manages a single major resource type from a provider (e.g., S3, ECS, EC2). Resource blocks are permitted. Must be agnostic, use official providers, and follow the latest skeleton and repo policies. Primitive modules are the most complex and where most raw development occurs. They require the highest level of expertise and scrutiny, as mistakes here can introduce security or compliance risks.
- **Utility Modules**: Adds opinionated functionality (e.g., naming/tagging) or provides data-only structures (such as resource naming constraints for every AWS resource). No resource blocks. Must be agnostic and live in this monorepo.
- **Collection Modules**: A composition of primitive modules and/or other collection modules. Collection modules can only import other modules (OPA enforced) and cannot contain resource blocks. They provide an opinionated, specialized set of resources to support a use case (e.g., EKS cluster integrated with SumoLogic or Datadog). They do not provide a full reference architecture but are designed to be integrated with reference modules for more complex use cases.
- **Reference Modules**: Provides a fully baked, production-ready service that is secure, observable, follows best practices, and modern architecture patterns. Reference modules are less complex than primitives, and are intended as the main entry point for most consumers. They offer a high degree of confidence, as they are fully tested for security, policy, governance, linting, formatting, and functional testing. Most users will consume reference or collection modules, not primitives.
- **Client Wrapper Modules**: Client-specific wrapper that imports reference modules and adds custom logic. Must live in the client’s repo and follow the same structure/testing standards.

All modules must follow the [required structure](terraform-module-structure.md) and [policies](terraform-module-policies.md).

## Development Guidelines
- No hard-coded values in Terraform code
- Variables must be declared in variables.tf
- Outputs must be declared in outputs.tf
- Provider configurations must be in versions.tf
- Local variables must be in locals.tf
- Write tests for all examples using the [Terraform Terratest Framework](https://github.com/matthew-dresden/terraform-terratest-framework)
- Ensure tests validate the module's core functionality
- Include common tests for validation, formatting, and outputs
- Create example-specific tests for unique features
- Follow the [test structure requirements](terraform-module-testing.md)
- Configure test behavior using the `test.config` file in the module root
- Control idempotency testing with `TERRATEST_IDEMPOTENCY=true|false` in the config file
- All Go test files must pass linting (`make go-lint`)
- All Go test files must be properly formatted (`make go-format`)

### PR Title Format and Version Bumps

**IMPORTANT**: Version bumps are determined by the **PR title**, not individual commit messages. When the pipeline auto-merges your PR, it creates a squash commit using the PR title as the commit message. This commit message is what determines the version bump type.

The following PR title prefixes and version bump rules apply to both Terraform module changes and non-Terraform changes in this repository.

This repository uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automated versioning and changelog generation. The type of version bump is determined by the **PR title prefix**:

| Prefix Example      | Version Bump | Description                                 |
|--------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `feat!:`           | Major        | Breaking change (any type with `!:`)        |
| `fix!:`            | Major        | Breaking change (any type with `!:`)        |
| `refactor!:`       | Major        | Breaking change (any type with `!:`)        |
| `BREAKING CHANGE`  | Major        | Footer contains `BREAKING CHANGE`           |
| `feat:`            | Minor        | New feature                                 |

| `revert:`          | Minor        | Revert commit                               |
| `release:`         | Minor        | Release commit                              |
| `module:`          | Minor        | Module-level change                         |
| `meta:`            | Minor        | Metadata change                             |

| `chore:`           | Patch        | Chore/maintenance                           |
| `docs:`            | Patch        | Documentation change                        |
| `style:`           | Patch        | Code style change                           |
| `refactor:`        | Patch        | Refactoring (non-breaking)                  |
| `test:`            | Patch        | Test-related change                         |

- **Use the appropriate prefix for your PR title** to ensure correct versioning.
- Individual commit messages within the PR do not affect versioning.
- The pipeline automatically merges approved PRs - **never merge PRs manually through the GitHub UI**.
- See `.github/SEMANTIC_RELEASE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for full details.
